# rock-paper-scissors

This program will allow a user to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer in the console.

UPDATE! I changed around the code in order to add a UI. Now the user no longer plays agains the computer in the console, but instead can play using the same code, but in a user interface. 

Still plenty to learn, but this was really my first time using DOM manipulation in a project.
